Simple Login Page with Tkinter
This project implements a basic login system using Python's Tkinter library and JSON for user data storage. It provides a graphical interface where users can input their username and password to log in.

Features:
Username and Password Authentication: Validates user credentials against data stored in a JSON file (users.json).
Feedback Messages: Displays messages for successful login, incorrect username/password, or empty fields.
GUI Design: Utilizes Tkinter for creating a user-friendly interface with labels, entry fields, and buttons.
How It Works:
User Input: Users enter their username and password into designated entry fields.
Validation: Validates the input against stored credentials from users.json.
Login Status: Provides feedback on the login attempt (success, incorrect credentials, or empty fields) through a status message displayed below the login button.
Technologies Used:
Python
Tkinter (for GUI)
JSON (for storing user data)
Usage:
Enter your username and password in the respective fields.
Click the "LOGIN" button to attempt login.
Receive feedback regarding the login attempt below the button.
Future Enhancements:
Implement secure password hashing.
Enhance GUI with more styling and features.
Expand user management functionalities such as registration and account management.
